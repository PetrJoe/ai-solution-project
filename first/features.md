Project Overview
The project involves developing a solution tailored to the specific requirements of AI-Solutions, based on the student's program of study. The goal is to create a prototype product and document the development process in a portfolio report. The project is divided into two main tasks:

Portfolio Report: A comprehensive document detailing the project's development, including requirements specification, planning, client interactions, methodology, design, testing, deployment, and critical reflection.

Prototype Product and Demonstration: A working solution that meets the agreed requirements, demonstrated through a pre-recorded video.

Specific Requirements Based on Program of Study
Depending on the student's program, the project requirements vary:

Applied Business Computing: Develop an online web system with a form for scheduling demos, promotional events, and a password-protected admin area for analyzing customer data.

Computer Systems Engineering: Create a website showcasing software solutions, customer feedback, articles, and event galleries. Include a "Contact Us" form for customer inquiries and a password-protected admin area.

Network Systems Engineering: Design and implement a secure network solution for a new office building, including network simulation, addressing scheme documentation, and evaluation of the network's design, implementation, and security.

Mobile and Web Technologies: Develop a mobile app for customers to interact with an AI-powered virtual assistant, with features for scheduling demos, inquiring about events, and chatting with sales representatives.

Business Intelligence and Data Analytics & Information and Communication Technology: Analyze product sales data using tools developed in R or Python. Create test data for web server logs and analyze the logs to provide insights into customer interactions and sales strategy effectiveness.

Key Deliverables
Portfolio Report: A single PDF file containing:

Requirements Specification
Planning Documentation
Client Contact Record Sheet
Methodology
Solution Design Documentation
Testing and Evaluation
Technical Deployment of the Solution
Critical Reflection
Prototype Product Demonstration: A video showcasing the functionality of the developed solution.

Submission
Portfolio Report: Submitted electronically as a PDF.
Prototype Demonstration: Submitted as a video demonstrating the solution's functionality.
Important Considerations
Plagiarism: The work must be original and properly referenced using the Harvard system.
Client Engagement: Regular meetings with the client (represented by the module tutor) are mandatory to ensure the project meets the client's needs.
Professional Documentation: The portfolio report should be professionally structured and coherent, reflecting the development process and outcomes.
This project aims to provide students with practical experience in product development, client engagement, and professional documentation, aligning with real-world industry practices.
